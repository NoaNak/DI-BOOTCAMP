Recipe website.
Very nice project!
The styling is great ! Good colors and positioning of elements. CSS A++
I would think of a way of storing all the information about each recipe in an object, so when adding a new recipe 
you dont have to create a html and css just for that recipe.
Just render the recipe on the screen with the information you get from the OBJ.
I would also in general like to see a little more scripting as we already know your styling is top tier :)
Great job Noa !!
